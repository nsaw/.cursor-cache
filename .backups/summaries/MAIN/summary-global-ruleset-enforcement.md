# Global Ruleset Enforcement Patch Summary

**Patch ID**: patch-v1.4.200(P0.00.01)_global-ruleset-enforcement  
**Date**: 2025-07-21 15:36:00  
**Status**: ✅ SUCCESS (CORRECTED)  

## SYNC: Summary routing corrected to .cursor-cache/summaries/MAIN

## Mutation Log
- ✅ Created `/Users/sawyer/gitSync/.cursor-cache/summaries/MAIN` directory
- ✅ Created `/Users/sawyer/gitSync/.cursor-cache/summaries/CYOPS` directory
- ✅ Rewrote `patch-executor.js` to route summaries to `.cursor-cache/summaries/MAIN`
- ✅ Rewrote `ghost-bridge.js` to route summaries to `.cursor-cache/summaries/MAIN`
- ✅ Updated `.cursor-config.json` with summaryPath and execution settings
- ✅ Rewrote `bridge_daemon.py` to route summaries to `.cursor-cache/summaries/CYOPS`
- ✅ Created backup at `/Users/sawyer/gitSync/_backups/tm-mobile-cursor/250721PT_patch-v1.4.200(P0.00.01)_global-ruleset-enforcement_backup_tm-mobile-cursor.tar.gz`
- ✅ **CORRECTED**: Fixed directory structure from `.cursor-cache/MAIN/summaries` to `.cursor-cache/summaries/MAIN`

## Runtime Effects Traced
- **Before**: Summary routing scattered across multiple local directories
- **After**: Centralized summary routing to `.cursor-cache/summaries` structure:
  - MAIN summaries: `/Users/sawyer/gitSync/.cursor-cache/summaries/MAIN`
  - CYOPS summaries: `/Users/sawyer/gitSync/.cursor-cache/summaries/CYOPS`

## Service Validation
- ✅ Summary file creation: Working correctly in correct location
- ✅ SYNC marker validation: Present in summary
- ✅ Runtime validation: Passed hydration guard verification
- ✅ Directory structure: Created and accessible with correct hierarchy
- ✅ Backup creation: Successfully archived original files

## Commit Gates Passed
- ✅ All target files modified successfully
- ✅ Summary routing logic implemented correctly
- ✅ Validation scripts executed without errors
- ✅ SYNC marker found in summary file
- ✅ Clean state confirmed
- ✅ **CORRECTED**: Directory structure now matches expected pattern

## Validation Results
- **Summary File**: Created at `/Users/sawyer/gitSync/.cursor-cache/summaries/MAIN/summary-global-ruleset-enforcement.md`
- **SYNC Marker**: Present in summary content
- **Runtime Validation**: Passed hydration guard verification
- **Directory Structure**: Both MAIN and CYOPS directories created under `.cursor-cache/summaries/`
- **Backup**: Original files safely archived

## Next Steps
Global ruleset enforcement complete with corrected directory structure. All summary routing now centralized to `.cursor-cache/summaries/` structure for consistent GPT/Cursor operations across all gitSync projects.
